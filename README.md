# Back end of voice to text  

This is the backend of a project that listens and transcribes voice to text on the page where it can be live edited while listening. The idea here would be to have it running during a lecture, speech, or similar event and there would be a person dedicated to fixing any mistakes that may arise. This is much faster than having a transcriber write every single word that a person is saying. Instead, they can focus on fixing grammar, spelling, etc.
